- Created `/var/log/auth.log` using `tee` to bypass shell redirection permission issues.
- Deleted the log to simulate attacker log wiping.
- Checked `/var/log/audit/audit.log` → file not found.
- Checked `/var/log/syslog` → file not found.
- Attempted recovery using `strings` and `grep` → no fragments.
- Learned that without auditd or syslog, log tampering leaves no trace.
- This lab demonstrates the importance of:
  - audit logging
  - log backups
  - immutable logs
  - centralised logging (SIEM)
